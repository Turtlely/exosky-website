            <h2>The Universe is an Immense, Expanding Entity</h2>
            <p>
                The universe is an immense, expanding entity, with the observable universe stretching approximately 
                <strong>93 billion light-years</strong> in diameter. This vastness challenges our ability to comprehend 
                distances, structures, and time scales. The metric often used to communicate these immense distances 
                is the light-year, the distance that light, traveling at approximately 300,000 kilometers per second, 
                covers in a single year (~9.46 trillion kilometers).
            </p>
            <h2>Expansion of the Universe</h2>
            <p>
                The universe is not static but expanding, as demonstrated by <strong>Hubble’s Law</strong>, which shows 
                a linear relationship between the distance of galaxies and their velocity moving away from us. This 
                discovery gave rise to the <strong>Big Bang Theory</strong>, suggesting that the universe began in an 
                incredibly dense, hot state roughly <strong>13.8 billion years ago</strong> and has been expanding ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hubble's constant (H₀), which measures the rate of this expansion, is central to cosmology. However, 
                determining its exact value has led to tension between early universe measurements (from the Cosmic 
                Microwave Background, CMB) and local universe measurements (using supernovae and galaxies). This ongoing 
                debate, often called the <strong>Hubble Tension</strong>, represents one of the most pressing questions 
                in modern cosmology.
            </p>
            <h2>Measuring Cosmic Distances</h2>
            <p>
                Astronomers use different techniques to measure distances, depending on how far the object is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Parallax:</strong> The apparent shift in the position of a nearby star as Earth orbits the Sun. 
                    This method is effective for stars within a few thousand light-years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Standard Candles:</strong> Objects like Cepheid variable stars and Type Ia supernovae, whose 
                    intrinsic luminosities are well-known, allow astronomers to determine their distances by comparing 
                    their true brightness to their apparent brightness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Redshift (z):</strong> Distant galaxies appear redder due to the stretching of light waves as 
                    the universe expands. The greater the redshift, the farther away the object is, offering insight into 
                    both distance and the universe's rate of expansion.
                </li>
            </ul>
