            <h2>The Universe is Filled with Diverse Objects</h2>
            <p>
                The universe is filled with diverse objects, from stars and planets to galaxies and black holes. Each 
                type plays a crucial role in understanding cosmic phenomena.
            </p>
            <h2>Stars</h2>
            <p>
                Stars are essentially nuclear reactors fueled by the fusion of hydrogen into helium in their cores. 
                Their lifetimes depend on their mass, with more massive stars burning through their fuel much more quickly 
                than smaller stars.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Stellar Classification:</strong> Stars are classified by their spectral type, which is based on 
                their surface temperature and the absorption lines in their spectra. The types range from O (blue, 
                hottest, and most massive) to M (red, coolest, and least massive). Our Sun is a G-type star, sitting 
                roughly in the middle of this sequence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mass of a star determines its fate. Small stars, like red dwarfs, can burn for hundreds of billions 
                of years, while massive O-type stars may explode as supernovae after only a few million years.
            </p>
            <h2>Planets</h2>
            <p>
                Planets form from the protoplanetary disks of gas and dust surrounding young stars. Their characteristics 
                depend on their location within the disk:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Terrestrial planets:</strong> Rocky, metal-rich worlds that form closer to the star where the 
                    heat prevents lighter gases from condensing. Earth, Venus, Mars, and Mercury are examples.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gas giants:</strong> These planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, form farther out, where the 
                    cooler temperatures allow hydrogen and helium to dominate their composition.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Black Holes and Neutron Stars</h2>
            <p>
                Black holes are formed when the core of a massive star collapses under its gravity after a supernova, 
                compressing matter into a singularityâ€”a point of infinite density. Neutron stars result from the collapse 
                of stars between 8 and 20 times the mass of the Sun. In these objects, protons and electrons merge to 
                form neutrons, and the star becomes an incredibly dense sphere just a few kilometers across.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both black holes and neutron stars exhibit extreme gravitational and relativistic effects, making them 
                key objects in testing theories of gravity, such as general relativity.
            </p>
            <h2>Galaxies</h2>
            <p>
                Galaxies are gravitationally bound systems composed of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter. They are 
                classified into types such as spiral galaxies (like the Milky Way), elliptical galaxies, and irregular 
                galaxies. Galaxies form hierarchical structures, often merging and interacting over billions of years, 
                which helps shape their evolution.
